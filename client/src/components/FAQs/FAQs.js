            I have accepted a proposal. What is the next step?
            <br />
            After having accepted a proposal, you must make the payment of the
            guarantee deposit in case it is a fixed price job, or if it were a
            project for hours, you must validate your payment method. From this
            you can start working.
            <br />
            To end the work, all that remains is for both to qualify. This
            qualification is confidential, you will only be able to see how the
            chosen professional has qualified you after you have already issued
            your qualification.
